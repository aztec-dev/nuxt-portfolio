## Vue.js Learning Journal Entry 1

## Date: 21/03/2024

### Summary

First off, what is Vue? Vue is a JavaScript framework used for building interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides declarative and component based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces.

This is what an example Vue code should look like:

```vue
import { createApp, ref } from 'vue'

createApp({
  setup() {
    return {
      count: ref(0)
    }
  }
}).mount('#app')
```

What I just learnt about Vue is that Vue uses something called the single-file component. This basically means that it composes a file using a Script (JavaScript), Template (HTML), and style (CSS) all in a single file. I have also learnt about API styles and what API's are available to use.
