## Vue.js Learning Journal Entry 1

## Date: 21/03/2024

### Summary

First off, what is Vue? Vue is a JavaScript framework used for building interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides declarative and component based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces.

This is what an example Vue code should look like:

```vue
import { createApp, ref } from 'vue'

createApp({
  setup() {
    return {
      count: ref(0)
    }
  }
}).mount('#app')
```

What I just learnt about Vue is that Vue uses something called the single-file component. This basically means that it composes a file using a Script (JavaScript), Template (HTML), and style (CSS) all in a single file. I have also learnt about API styles and what API's are available to use.

I also took on the opportunity to use the integrated editor to try out basic Vue components.

Finally, I started working on my very own vue application, which is still a work in progress.

### Challenges

It was a bit difficult to understand how to use the APIs' and what the '@' symbol means. It is a bit overwhelming seeing all of the APIs' and not knowing how and when to use them.

The main challenges are in the style section as I dont really understand how to style a webpage yet.

### Solutions

I believe the main solution to my problem is time and persitence. I think that I should become more familiar with the APIs' the more I use them and my styling should improve over time.

### Key Takeaways

The key takaways are:

- The structure of a Vue application consists script, template and style

- The use of APIs' - when and how to use them

### Next Steps

I will try to get more familiar with the structure of it and how to use basic features like v-for and other scripting components of Vue.

### Reflection

This learning entry was a simple one to act as a place holder so take it with a grain of salt.
